    Pokemon Quest is a Freemium mobile game currently out on Nintendo Switch and releasing
    for mobile on June 2018.
</p>

<p>
    The game starts by taking you to a new island in the pokemon universe that is
    inhabited by the original 150 Pokemon. Like most Pokemon games, you collect a team of
    pokemon that battle for you. You level up the pokemon and defeat tougher and tougher
    bosses. But in this game there's a few big differences from a classic Pokemon RPG
</p>

<h2>
    Collecting Pokemon
</h2>
<p>
    You start out with a choice of one of 5 pokemon: Eevee, Pikachu, Charmander, Squirtle,
    or Bulbasaur. Instead of catching Pokemon in the wild, you collect ingredients dropped
    by defeated pokemon and use those to cook a dish. Depending on what type of dish you
    cooked, it will attract one or two pokemon.

<h2>
    Battling Pokemon
</h2>

<p>
    When you take your team into a battle, they'll move automatically. They can fight
    automatically too, but this is not recommended for tough battles since the AI is not
    very good.
</p>

<p>
    The main things you can control in a battle is when to use a move and when your
    pokemon should run away. The run away/scatter mechanic is very useful for dodging
    attacks and getting through tough battles with a win.
</p>

<p>
    It's also important to time your attacks well. For instance, if your pokemon is too
    far away their attack will miss and you'll have to wait for the cooldown period before
    attacking again.
